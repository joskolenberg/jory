# Jory
Jory is a way of defining database queries using a JSON string, useful for loading dynamic data from the front-end.

This package primarily acts as a support package for the [Laravel Jory](https://packagist.org/packages/joskolenberg/laravel-jory) package.

For more information take a look at the [docs](https://laravel-jory.kolenberg.net/docs).


Happy coding!
